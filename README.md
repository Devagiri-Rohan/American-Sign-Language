# To Connekt
* To Connekt is a project which helps specially abled people to interact with others. 
* Model is trained based on the American Sign Language dataset.
* Now, the model can take a gesture as real time input from the user and convert it into speech.
* In fututre updates, I'm going to develop the model to convert the voice of the specially abled person into the gestures in real time and perform the vice versa 
* This helps the users to directly interact and share their thoughts in a much better way
